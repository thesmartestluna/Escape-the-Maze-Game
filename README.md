# Escape-the-Maze-Game
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> This project is a course project in CS61B (data strucuture & algorithm course in Berkeley). IT's a 2D tile-based world generation and exploration game. I built a complicated maze (randomly generated through random seed) where users could interact and explore. </P>
<p> The goal of the game is to escape from the maze before your life reduces to 0. If the player gets a flower, life will increase by one. If the player crashes into a tree, life will decrease by one. If the number of lives decreases to zero, the player will die. The player must reach the golden exit with at least one life to survive the game.</p>
