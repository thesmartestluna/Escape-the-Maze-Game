# Escape-the-Maze-Game
<h2> Introduction </h2>
<p> This project is a course project in CS61B (data strucuture & algorithm course in Berkeley). IT's a 2D tile-based world generation and exploration game. I built a complicated maze (randomly generated through random seed) where users could interact and explore. </P>
<p> The goal of the game is to escape from the maze before your life reduces to 0. If the player gets a flower, life will increase by one. If the player crashes into a tree, life will decrease by one. If the number of lives decreases to zero, the player will die. The player must reach the golden exit with at least one life to survive the game. Instead of rushing to find the way to the exit as fast as possible, the player should first try to collect flowers, as dangerous trees often stand in the way to the exit.</p>
<h2> Demo of the Game </h2>

<h2> Coding Details </h2>
<ul>
  <li> The hallways in the maze are generated by recursive backtracking algorithm. </li>
  <li> The rooms are generated by unoverlapped random rectangles with ranges of sizes. </li>
  <li> I also enable the user to interact with the world (moving around the maze, collecting items etc.) </li>
</ul>
<h2> How to run </h2>
<ol>
  <li> Git clone this repository and library-sp18 folder (in CS61B skeleton folder), which contains essential libraries </li>
  <li> Run with IntelliJ/ Compile in terminal</li>
